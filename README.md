## Coding convention
## Settings
## Linter and formatter
This repository contains linting and formatting rules. 

> `Linting rules are hooked with git commit command. If any linting rule breaks it will throw error. These rules are there to keep code clean`.

The following are commands to manually check and auto fix linting errors. **But it is re-commended that you should fix all the error manually.**
```sh
# Check linting errors
$ npm run lint

# Auto fix linting errors
$ npm run fix-lint
```

For formatting code files, we are using `Prettier` settings please check '.prettierrc'.

> `In order to adhere to standard formatting please ignore setting up formatter in your IDE (VSCode) via plugins`

```sh
# Auto format
$ npm run format
```
